# AGENTS.md — webtyp/storage

Working notes for AI agents operating in this library. For end-user docs see [README.md](README.md).
The implementation plan lives in [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) — self-contained, inlines the exact
code to write (this repo is a fresh `gonew`, there is nothing to reference by import yet).

## Mission of this package

`webtyp/storage` is the **storage port** of the webtyp ecosystem: the contract a storage backend
(`postgres`, `sqlt`, `indexdb`) must implement (`Executor`+`Compiler`, unified as `Conn`), the DML
value types that cross that boundary (`Query`/`Condition`/`Order`/`Plan`), an executable conformance
suite (`storage/conformance`), an in-memory reference backend (`storage/mem`), and test recorders (`storage/mock`).

It is the exact equivalent of `database/sql/driver` in the Go stdlib. `webtyp/orm` (the query
builder, `Create`/`Update`/`Delete`/`Where`/`ReadAll`) is the equivalent of `database/sql` — an
**optional ergonomic layer** on top of this contract, never the other way around. See
[`app-releases/docs/DB_PORT_PROPOSAL.md`](https://github.com/webtyp/app/blob/main/docs/DB_PORT_PROPOSAL.md)
for the full architectural reasoning.

**This package must be usable standalone**, without ever importing `orm`. A backend author, or `ddl`,
or a leaf module writing infrastructure code, talks to `storage` directly.

## Architectural rules (do not violate)

### This is THE foundational isomorphic library — the strictest rules in the ecosystem apply

`storage` is imported by every storage backend, including WASM-only ones (`indexdb`). There is no
"backend-only, gate it behind `!wasm`" escape hatch for anything in this repo — every file here must
compile clean under `GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm` **and** under TinyGo (`gotest -tinygo`). Verify both before
considering any change done.

### No Go `map` anywhere — no exceptions, not even "just this once"

**Never use a built-in `map[K]V`, in any file.** TinyGo's map runtime is heavy and adds meaningful,
unavoidable size to every wasm binary that imports this code, directly or transitively (which is
every backend and every app in the ecosystem — this is the most-imported package after `model` and
`fmt`). A map introduced here is a tax paid by the entire ecosystem, forever.

- For a **string→string** pair, use `webtyp.com/fmt.KeyValue{Key, Value string}`.
- For anything else (a table's rows, a row's columns, a lookup by name), use a small local
  slice-of-structs scanned linearly. See `storage/mem`'s `dbCell`/`dbRow`/`dbTable` (docs/PLAN.md §5) —
  every collection in this repo is tiny (one table's columns, one row's cells), so a linear scan
  costs nothing measurable.
- If you're tempted to add a map "just for a lookup cache," don't. Reach for a linear scan first, and
  only reconsider with a profiler backing you up, never on a hunch.

### No `database/sql`, no `reflect`, no query builder

- **No `database/sql` import, anywhere in this repo.** `storage` is the agnostic contract; leaking a
  driver-specific type here would defeat the entire point of the port. Adapters (in their own repos)
  are responsible for translating `database/sql` semantics (e.g. `sql.ErrNoRows`) into this package's
  sentinels (`storage.ErrNoRows`) — that translation happens in the adapter, never here.
- **No `reflect`.** All types in this package are plain structs with exported getter methods
  (`Condition.Field()`, `Order.Column()`, …). Struct tags, if ever relevant, are a build-time (`ormc`)
  concern — not this package's.
- **No query builder, no `DB` type, no `Where`/`OrderBy` fluent API.** That is `orm`'s job — an
  optional layer built on top of this contract, deliberately kept out of it (see DB_PORT_PROPOSAL.md
  §6.3/§6.4/§6.8: the builder is invariant glue written once, not part of what varies per backend).
  Do not add ergonomic sugar here "to make `storage` nicer to use directly" — if it doesn't vary by
  backend, it doesn't belong in the contract.
- **No DDL.** `CreateTable`/`Sync`/schema management lives in `webtyp/ddl`, a separate repo that
  consumes `storage.Conn` + `storage.Compiler`. This package has zero opinions about schema.
- **No DSN registry (`Open`/`Register`).** A string-keyed lookup that fails at runtime ("unknown
  scheme") is exactly the kind of thing the construction harness forbids (fail at compile time, not
  runtime). Backends expose typed constructors (`sqlt.Open(dsn) (storage.Conn, error)`); assembly with the
  ergonomic layer is the consumer's explicit `orm.New(conn)` call. Do not add a registry here.

### `Conn` is the seam — never split it back into two arguments

`Conn interface { Executor; Compiler }` exists so a backend is passed around as **one** value. Every
real backend implements both halves in the same concrete type anyway (there is no such thing as an
`Executor` from one backend paired with a `Compiler` from another) — `Conn` makes that pairing the
only representable state. If you're writing a constructor or a `Factory` field, it takes/returns
`storage.Conn`, not `(Executor, Compiler)`.

## Code layout

| File / Dir | Role |
|------------|------|
| `executor.go` | `Executor`, `Scanner`, `Rows` — what a backend runs a compiled `Plan` through |
| `compiler.go` | `Compiler` — translates a `Query` into a `Plan` |
| `conn.go` | `Conn` = `Executor` + `Compiler`, the single value a backend hands back |
| `tx.go` | `TxExecutor`, `TxBoundExecutor` — optional transaction capability |
| `query.go` | `Action`, `Order` (+`Asc`/`Desc`), `Query` — the DML value types |
| `conditions.go` | `Condition` + constructors (`Eq`, `Gt`, `In`, `Or`, `IsNotNull`, …) |
| `execution_plan.go` | `Plan` — what `Compile` produces and `Exec`/`Query` consumes |
| `errors.go` | `ErrNoRows` — the sentinel every backend must map its driver's no-rows error to; callers detect it with `IsNoRows(err)`, never `==`/`errors.Is` (reflection under TinyGo) |
| `scan.go` | `ScanAny` — typed value → pointer, used by `storage/mem` and host-side adapters |
| `conformance/` | Executable DML contract (`Run(t, Factory)`), built on raw `Query` values — no builder |
| `mem/` | `mem.New() storage.Conn` — functional in-memory reference backend, no map, no driver |
| `mock/` | Recorders (`mock.Executor`, `mock.Compiler`, …) — capture calls, don't execute anything |
| `tests/` | Centralized testing directory containing all test suites for domain types |
| `docs/` | `PLAN.md` (self-contained implementation plan, delete after `gopush`), architecture notes |

## Testing & Directory Organization

**All `*_test.go` files must be centralized in the `tests/` directory under root.**
Tests should not be scattered across individual domain folders (`mem/`, `mock/`, etc.). This layout helps preserve shared setup logic, prevents package clutter, and increases code maintainability.

The file prefix must correspond to the domain package it exercises, followed by the specific test cases.
Examples:
- `tests/storage_helpers_test.go` (tests for root package constructs like `Condition`, `Order`, `ScanAny`)
- `tests/mem_conformance_test.go` (tests conformance suite over `mem` engine)
- `tests/mem_extra_test.go` (tests additional/extra behaviors of the reference `mem` engine)
- `tests/mock_extra_test.go` (tests additional/extra behaviors of the mock package)

All test files inside `tests/` use `package tests`. This enforces that they only consume the public APIs exported by each package, mirroring real-world end-user behaviors and preserving modular design.

Install test runner once:

```bash
go install webtyp.com/devflow/cmd/gotest@latest
```

Run:

```bash
gotest              # vet + race + cover + wasm + badges
gotest -tinygo       # also compiles against the TinyGo compiler — mandatory for this repo
gotest -no-cache    # force re-run
gotest -run TestX   # filter
```

Publish with `gopush 'message'` (tests + tag + push) — never `git commit`/`git push` directly.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Reaching for `map[K]V` anywhere → use `fmt.KeyValue` or a small local slice-of-structs scanned
  linearly instead. No exceptions, not even in a test helper.
- Adding a `Where`/`OrderBy`-style method to `Query`, `Condition`, or anything in this package →
  that's `orm`'s job. If it makes `storage` "nicer to use directly," it's ergonomic sugar and belongs one
  layer up.
- Splitting `Conn` back into two constructor/factory arguments (`exec Executor, compiler Compiler`) →
  defeats the reason `Conn` exists. Take/return one `storage.Conn`.
- Forgetting `gotest -tinygo` — a change that only passes `go test`/`GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build` but
  not TinyGo is not done. TinyGo's stdlib subset and map runtime behavior differ from both.
- Importing `database/sql` or any concrete driver "just to check a type" → never, not even in a test.
